## Part 2 - CODING CHALLENGE 1

 Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
 
 `BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height)`

 Mass in kg and Height in meter.

 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables.
 2. Calculate both their BMIs.
 3. Craete a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
 4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like _"Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true"_);
